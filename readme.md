# YQM: YouTube Queue Manager

## About
A Chrome extension that helps boost productivity and corrals time spend on YouTube.
The main feature is disabling the queue functionality by removing the UI to add videos to 
the queue playlist. This encourages purposeful browsing and prevents aimless video
video accumulation in queue from recommended, subscriptions, or trending videos
which are huge time sinks. Upcoming features will allow for setting hard caps for 
items in queue and total watch time for said items.
